Certainly, here are some steps I recommend:

Collect a large dataset of images containing the objects and actions you want to detect. This could be hundreds or thousands of images. More data leads to better accuracy.

Preprocess the images by resizing them to a consistent size and format. Also convert the images to grayscale if it helps simplify the model.

Define a convolutional neural network architecture with:

Convolutional layers to extract features from the images
Pooling layers to reduce spatial size
Fully connected layers for classification
Train the CNN on the preprocessed image data to detect the objects of interest. The output will be a set of class probabilities for each object class.

During testing, feed an input image through the CNN to detect the objects. This will output the class probabilities and predicted class for each detected object.

Calculate the positions of the detected objects within the image. This will give you the bounding box coordinates.

Analyze how the detected objects are moving and interacting over multiple frames of a video. This could reveal certain actions.

Implement algorithms to map combinations of detected objects and their movements to specific action classes (e.g. playing catch, dancing, hugging).

Display the detected objects on the input image or video with bounding boxes, along with the recognized actions.

Save the output frames to create an annotated video with detected objects and recognized actions.
