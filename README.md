# CV_project

For a basic object detection and action recognition project, the libraries we discussed so far should cover the main functionality:

cv2 - For essential computer vision tasks like reading images/videos and displaying output
numpy - For representing image data in arrays
pandas - For loading your dataset
tensorflow/keras - For building and training deep learning models
scikit-learn - For useful ML tools like train/test splits
matplotlib - For visualizing and analyzing results
However, depending on the specific algorithms and techniques you plan to use, you may need to import additional libraries. Some possibilities:

YOLO - To implement the You Only Look Once real-time object detection algorithm, you'll need to import darknet
SSD - For the Single Shot MultiBox Detector algorithm, import ssdmobilenet
RNNs - To implement recurrent neural networks for sequence modeling and action recognition, import keras.layers.LSTM
pose estimation - For tasks like body/hand pose estimation, import openpose
tracking - For multi-object tracking, import sort or deep_sort
And there are many other useful computer vision libraries beyond the core OpenCV functionality, like:

imgaug - For image augmentation
PIL/Imutils - For additional image processing tools
pycocotools - For the COCO dataset and evaluation metrics
autokeras - For automated neural architecture search
So depending on the specific algorithms you plan to use, you may need to import additional libraries beyond the basics we've covered. Let me know which algorithms you're considering implementing and I can recommend the relevant libraries to import.
