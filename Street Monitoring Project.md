• Collect a large dataset of street scene images with vehicles and pedestrians at varying distances, angles, poses, and with different lighting conditions. This data will form the basis of your model training.

• Preprocess the images by cropping to the street scene, resizing to a standard size, and converting to grayscale. This will normalize the input for your algorithm.

• Build a convolutional neural network that can detect and classify objects into categories like "car", "truck", "person", "bicycle" etc. The output will be object classes and bounding boxes.

• Train the model to detect the objects and classify them accurately in your street scene images. Use data augmentation to increase the dataset size.

• For detected vehicles, you can then analyze the relative position, size and movement of the bounding box across multiple frames of video. This can give an estimate of the vehicle's speed and direction of travel.

• The same approach could work for analyzing the motion of detected pedestrians to estimate their speed and movement patterns.

• You can provide a real-time visual output showing the detected objects along with their estimated speed and motion on the input video frames.

• Performance metrics like detection accuracy, speed estimation error and processing speed can help evaluate and improve your model.
